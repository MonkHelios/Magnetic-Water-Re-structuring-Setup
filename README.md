# Magnetic Water Re-structuring Device
>Inspired by Ken Wheeler

## revision 1.0

An inverted 2L bottle acts as the reservoir which is filled with unstructured water. It reaches the re-structuring unit which is nothing but 10 turns of a flexible water pipe around a N52 grade NdFeB magnet with its poles on the square sides (2" x 2" x 0.5"). The water stream crosses the plane of inertia of the magnet 10 times after being directed to the output valve. The valve maintains the output flow rate at a slow dripping pace which is necessary for a proper re-structuring. The re-structured water is discharged into an empty bottle.
